# 🤖 Line Follower Robot using Arduino

A smart line-following robot built with **Arduino UNO**, **IR sensors**, and an **L298N motor driver**. It autonomously follows a black line on a white surface using sensor feedback and motor control logic.

---

## 📌 Description

🔍 This robot detects and follows a black line using IR sensors and adjusts its direction with motor drivers. It's a basic but essential project in embedded systems and robotics for learning automation and control.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- 👀 **IR sensors** detect black vs white surfaces.
- 🧠 **Arduino UNO** processes sensor inputs.
- ⚙️ **Motor Driver (L298N)** drives the motors based on logic.
- 🔋 A **battery pack** powers the entire system.
